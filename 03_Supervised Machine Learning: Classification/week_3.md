## Q1. Select the TRUE statement regarding the cost function for SVMs:
- [ ] SVMs do not use a cost function. They use regularization instead of a cost function.
- [ ] SVMs use a loss function that penalizes vectors prone to misclassification
- [ ] SVMs use same loss function as logistic regression
- [x] SVMs use the Hinge Loss function as a cost function

Q2. Which statement about Support Vector Machines is TRUE?

- [ ] Support Vector Machine models are non-linear. 
- [x] Support Vector Machine models rarely overfit on training data.
- [ ] Support Vector Machine models can be used for regression but not for classification. 
- [ ] Support Vector Machine models can be used for classification but not for regression. 


## Q3. (True/False) A large c term will penalize the SVM coefficients more heavily.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Q4. Regularization in the context of support vector machine (SVM) learning is meant to _________________.

- [ ] smooth the input data to reduce the chance of overfitting
- [x] lessen the impact that some minor misclassifications have on the cost function
- [ ] encourage the model to ignore outliers during training
- [ ] bring all features to a common scale to ensure they have equal weight

## Q5. Support vector machines can be extended to work with nonlinear classification boundaries by ___________________.

- [ ] modifying the standard sigmoid function
- [x] using the kernel trick

- [x] RBF Sampler
- [ ] Regularization
- [ ] Linear SVC

## Q9. Concerning the Machine Learning workflow what model choice would you pick if you have "Few" features and a "Medium" amount of data?
- [ ] Add features, or Logistic 
- [ ] Simple, Logistic or LinearSVC 
- [x] SVC with RBF
